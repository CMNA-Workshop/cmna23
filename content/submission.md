# Workshop Categories


The workshop encourages submissions in four categories:

* Long papers, either reporting on completed work or offering a polemic discussion on a burning issue (up to 10 pages).
* Short papers describing work in progress (up to 5 pages).
* Demos (2 page abstract describing the demo)
* Posters (2 page abstract explaining the concept behind the poster).

All accepted submissions will be archived locally on this site. Long & short papers will also be archved through CEUR workshop proceedings. Demos & posters will only be archived locally.

It is highly recommended, but not mandatory, to format papers using the [CEUR Single Column Style](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/) (more details below in the style section). 

## Regular (Long & Short) Paper Submission

Long & Short Paper submission will be handled by the Easychair conference system. Please submit your paper here via easychair: 

* https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmna23

## Poster & Demo Abstract Submission

Poster & Demo abstracts should be submitted directly to the organising committee and not through easychair.


# Pre-Proceedings Submission

We've gotten into the habit recently of publishing pre-proceedings shortly before the workshop so that folk can attend having prepared for the workshop, knowing what to expect, and being ready to engage with the presented work. So we plan to publish proceedings for CMNA 23 through [CEUR Workshop Proceedings](http://ceur-ws.org/) as has happened in previous years.  For final proceedings submission we'll use the [CEUR styles](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/) specifically the single column style from [this page](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/).
